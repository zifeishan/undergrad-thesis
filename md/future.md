In the future, we want to adopt GameRank on other sports networks, as well as conducting further analysis on the baseball network.

First, we want to collect data of American football, soccer, basketball,
etc., to build networks on these datasets and rank players considering
competition relationships.

Second, we want to dig into baseball networks, including study of
relationships between players' salaries and their rankings, prediction
of players' overall and play-specific performance, and study the impact
of real-time events to the evaluation process.

Besides, we want to build heterogeneous sports networks considering
other relationships than competitions. Specifically, we want to consider
supportive relationships and model their coexistence with competitions
on the network.
